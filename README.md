# obj
Simple, incomplete .obj reader

Did I mention that the test coverage might not be great?

This is the code I currently use to parse .obj files containing flat shaded meshes of different colours.  Large parts of the obj file (and the materials file) are ignored.


If anyone wants to extend it, feel free!  Hopefully it's useful to someone other than me.
